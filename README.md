# Scarlett_et_al_2022
Here you will find the scripts that were used in the Bhyb26 publication by Scarlett et al. "Multiple origins, one evolutionary trajectory: gradual
evolution characterizes distinct lineages of allotetraploid Brachypodium". This repository includes not only the scripts that produced the figures, but also the scripts that produced the data used in the figures, that is, the analysis pipelines. See the data availability section of the paper for the links to the raw data themselves.
